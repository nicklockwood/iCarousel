#pragma mark Spell Checking Hacks Of Doom

// These horrible spell checking hacks are here because when in a layer, NSTextView appears to refuse to properly support spell checking.
// It seems that, as of now (10.6.5) there's a variety of problems.
//
// 1) It doesn't even try to draw the red underlines when a word is misspelled.
// 2) When typing, it doesn't appear to correctly update the misspelled state even if it *did* draw the lines correctly.
// 
// I worked around #1 by just implementing my own drawing routine and telling the NSLayoutManager not to draw temp attributes itself just in
// case Apple were to fix some of this in 10.7. (Otherwise I suspect we'd end up with multiple underlines that don't quite match, etc.)
//
// As for #2...
//
// It seems that when in a layer (or as some side effect of how I'm manipulating things here to hack this into UIKit), NSTextView will set the
// range of the word the cursor is touching/within to be spelled correctly even if it isn't. (It's always setting the spelling state to 0 no
// matter what I do). This results in words never being marked as misspelled, therefore even my hack to draw the underline fails. To work
// around this, I'm detecting when the text and/or the cursor's position have changed and setting a timer for a short time. When the timer
// expires, I'm forcing a check of the entire text of the NSTextView. This seemingly results in updating the spelling state correctly for all
// but the word that the cursor might happen to be in. This appears to be about the best I can come up with given the documentation and
// unwillingness to resort to private APIs. It's not right, though, and you can feel it when using the text view. There's weird lags and
// timings when it decides to do a spell check. It's also not very effecient to be rechecking the entire text view, but I'm hoping some other
// approach and/or a fix from Apple appears before that ever becomes a real problem. In the current project, there's never any very large text
// views so I'm not worried too much about performance right now.
//
// This pretty much totally sucks and is just one of many places that using layer-backed NSViews has caused insane problems and resulted in
// stupid workarounds or compromises. Frustration doesn't even being to cover it. The amazing thing, is that all this stuff appears to have
// been broken since at least 10.5 when layers were first introduced. I suspect all the layer guys on the AppKit team were stolen for the
// iOS team and it all fell *way* behind. I'm really hoping this crap is cleaned up in 10.7. Of course if they go ahead and just ship UIKit
// in 10.7, I'll be kinda pissed about that, too... so... uh... yeah...
